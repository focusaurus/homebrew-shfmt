# Homebrew Tap for shfmt

This repo is a [homebrew](http://brew.sh) Tap so you can install the excellent [shfmt](https://github.com/mvdan/sh) shell script autoformatter.

## How to install

```sh
brew tap focusaurus/homebrew-shfmt
brew install shfmt
```

## Supported OS

Homebrew is focused on macOS, so this Tap supports installing shfmt on macOS. However, shfmt itself is a golang program and supports additional operating systems.
